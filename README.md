## 🎯 Project Goal

Forecast **num_orders** for upcoming 10 weeks so fulfillment centers can plan raw materials, reduce waste (~15–20%), and improve operations — a real problem faced by food delivery platforms like Zomato & Swiggy.

**Evaluation Metric**: RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error) — lower is better

**Best Model**: LightGBM (tuned with Optuna)  
**Validation RMSLE**: **0.4461** (very strong result)

## 📊 Key Results at a Glance

| Metric                  | Value       | Note                              |
|-------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Best Validation RMSLE   | 0.4461      | After Optuna tuning (30 trials)   |
| Top Predicted Food      | Rice Bowl (Indian) | Dominates peak weeks 150–155     |
| Highest Single Prediction | ~5,381 orders | Week 154, TYPE_A center, with promotion |
| Main Demand Driver      | Promotions  | Active in ~90% of top predictions |
| Best Center Type        | TYPE_A      | Highest average predicted demand  |

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhanalakshmi-S645/Food-Demand-Forecasting.git
   cd Food-Demand-Forecasting

2. Install required libraries
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn lightgbm xgboost optuna scikit-learn

3.open the notebook
  jupyter notebook "Food_Demand_Forecasting(Finall).ipynb

🌟 Highlights & Business Impact

Rice Bowl (Indian) dominates most peak weeks — especially in TYPE_A centers with promotions
Promotions lift demand significantly — appear in nearly all top predictions
TYPE_A centers (premium locations) consistently show highest average predicted orders
City code 590 appears most often — major demand hub

Real-world value: Accurate forecasts help centers order exact raw materials → reduce waste by 15–20% → save money & help the environment.
